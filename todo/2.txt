## dynamic setspeed max

the set speed max is currently 28mph.

toyota tssp min speed is 28mph, tss2 is 18mph?

make this limit dynamic to work for other car.

### why
preserve the current behavior where
this app just fills the gap between min cruise stalk set speed
and 0mph.


### also
maybe make it only activate/work when pcm cruise is at that minimum
